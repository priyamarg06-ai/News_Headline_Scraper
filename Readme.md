# Task 3 - News Headline Web Scraper

This project is part of my Python Developer Internship.  
The task is to create a Python program that scrapes the top news headlines from a website and saves them into a text file.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Used the **Requests** library to get the HTML content of a news website (BBC News).
- Used **BeautifulSoup** to extract the main headlines from HTML tags like <h1>, <h2>, and <h3>.
- Saved the collected headlines in a text file named **headlines.txt**.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- requests  
- beautifulsoup4  

## 📂 Output
After running the script, a file named `headlines.txt` is created automatically with the latest headlines.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

2. Run the Python file:

python task3_news_scraper.py

3. The output will appear in the `headlines.txt` file.
